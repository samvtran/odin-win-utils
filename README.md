# Windows Utils in Odin

This is a personal collection of Windows utilities written in Odin.
Some of these are one-off exploration and others are little helpers
triggered with [LibreAutomate](https://www.libreautomate.com/).

These aren't intended to be particularly safe or usable for anyone else, but
they're hopefully a jumping off point if you've stumbled upon these while looking
for Win32 FFI examples.

# Running

```shell
odin run .\color_profiles -collection:collections=collections
